# gmod-fakeoverlay
Prank your players with fake loading/disconnect screen. F-U-N! FUN ^ 2!

_When admins be ğŸ˜ˆ, others be ğŸ˜†, and the victim be ğŸ˜“._

I have written this in a very very short period of time (< 48 hours), so if you find any bugs (even a typo), please [submit it here](https://github.com/CaptainPRICE/gmod-fakeoverlay/issues/new)!


# Features
- Show fake overlay with custom message to any player
- Grained control (callbacks when victim receives/closes fake overlay on both serverside and clientside) / 3rd party addons support
- **???** (request new features via [issues tracking page](https://github.com/CaptainPRICE/gmod-fakeoverlay/issues))

# Getting Started
It is simple. Clone/Download a copy of the master branch into `./Steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons/gmod-fakeoverlay` folder (git will automatically create `gmod-fakeoverlay` folder for you; if you don't use git then create the folder yourself, how you name the addon folder does not really matter).
This is how the folder structure/hierarchy tree should look like:

```
addons
â””â”€â”€â”€gmod-fakeoverlay
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€lua
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€autorun
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€â”€client
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€â”€server
    â””â”€â”€â”€materials
        â””â”€â”€â”€fakeover
```

# Usage
By default, any admin on the server will be granted to run/execute the `sv_send_fakeover` console command. For more information, submit `help sv_send_fakeover` in Console.
